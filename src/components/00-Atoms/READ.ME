- Atoms contain generic base implementations used for more complex elements. 
They are built around reusability on multiple components, and lack any theming, just a common set of props
that may or may not be used by the different components that integrates them.

Example 1: SimpleInteractable
Is componsed of a leading icon, a label and a trailing icon.
It can be used by Button components, input components, chips or even simple list items.
It does contain styles, but barely enought to give it components structure structure 
(not bound to any kind of global style or component theming)
